## What is React ? 
The library for web and native user interfaces. From https://react.dev
### i.e - A library for building user interfaces. and A javascript library for building user interfaces
## Why we use React?
React since is javascript lib, use JS in the browser to update page and UI without reloading the page.
Because JS runs backgroud on the website and able to read, manipulate the webpage after webpage reload
Thus, when user interact some element, JS fetches the data behind in the background without reloading or leaving the page, update that data and leading move the transition between those pages.

## But why not just use JS?
Comparing with react and only JS,
1. It quickly becomes cumbersome.
2. error-prone
3. hard to maintain or edit code.
4. **react** offers a way simpler "mental model" = Vanilla JS를 사용하면 developer은 UI의 모든측면을 수동으로 다루어야함.
<br>OTOH, React에서는 부모-자식 관계의 component라는 개념에 focus되어있어서, Vanilla JS 보다 직관적으로 구조화가능. <br>i.e, 코드의 재사용성과 유지보수성이 증가함.
